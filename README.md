# HuffmanDecompression
Huffman coding is a symbol encoding algorithm used for data compression. It turns out to be the most efficient compression mechanism of this type and allows even very high compressions. The algorithm allows each symbol in the file to be associated with a sequence of bits smaller in size than the original symbol, based on the frequency with which each symbol appears. In this way, Huffman encoding allows a smaller number of bits to be used than if each symbol corresponded to an identical number of bits.  
  This mini-project consists of the implementation of Huffman's encoding algorithm in Java. Specifically, the algorithm is able to generate Huffman encoding from a text insterted by a user and consists of the following java classes:

This project was part of an exam I took during my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. The course was in italian language and therefore also the comments and variables within the code.
